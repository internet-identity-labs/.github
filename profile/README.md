# Internet Identity Labs

**Empowering users with ownership over Web3's most valuable layer.**

Welcome to Internet Identity Labs, where our mission is to give users ownership over Web3 wallets and their revenue streams.

While Web3 ideologies proclaim the end of centralized intermediaries, the corporations building wallets have extracted hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from its users' activity. Our focus is to decentralize this last bastion of inequality by building a DAO-governed wallet all on-chain.

### What we've built
We have three core products:
1. NFID Wallet: The DAO-controlled wallet, consisting of a [client](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/nfid-wallet-client/) and [backend](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/nfid-wallet-server/) codebase (both running on-chain on ICP).
2. NFID Vaults: The smart contract multi-signature wallet, consisting mainly of its [backend smart contract codebase](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/vault).
3. NFID IdentityKit: The [fix for ICP's wallet and identity problem](https://github.com/internet-identity-labs/identitykit).
